      <h2>My Career Goals</h2>
      <img class="computer-img" src="CSS - My Site Images/computer.png" alt="computer-img">
      <div class="content-mygoals">
        <p>Since October 2022 I am on a misson to become an <strong>excellent
          and productive programmer</strong>. I plan to find a job, training, or
          an internship in IT and in my free time continue learning programming by doing
          courses and completing projects.</p>
        <p>I chose programming because I like to mix <em>technicality with creativity</em>.
          All in the purpose of making something useful.</p>
        <p><strong>Python, HTML, and CSS</strong> are the three languages I feel comfortable with,
          but I plan to learn more and expand my skills.
        <p>
          I am enrolled in a self-paced Python course called 100
          Days of Code: Complete Python Pro-Bootcamp on Udemy. It's an amazing and
          comprehensive course! It covers main areas of programming: <strong>creating apps,
          websites, games, data science, automation, APIs, and more.</strong></p>
        <p>All of that learning by building projects! In short ... FUN!</p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

            <p class="my-ed">I fell in love with programming in October 2022. Since then I consume
            knowledge from programmers and I learn how to create cool, useful stuff.
            I enjoy <em>Lex Fridman Podcast</em> and all the legendary programmers
            that Lex talks to.
            <p>I love coding because it unlocks enormous possibilities to influence life
            in a fun, useful and creative ways.
